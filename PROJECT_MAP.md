- Collections (Vec, arrays)

**Key Takeaway:** Rust is explicit and safe by default

**Time:** 15 minutes
**Difficulty:** ⭐☆☆☆☆

---

### Module 2: Ownership (ownership.rs) ⚡ MOST IMPORTANT
**Topics:**
- Ownership rules (each value has one owner)
- Borrowing (&T immutable, &mut T mutable)
- Lifetimes (compiler ensures references are valid)
- Smart pointers (Box, Arc, etc.)

**Key Takeaway:** This enables memory safety without GC!

**Time:** 30 minutes
**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆

---

### Module 3: Data Structures (structs_enums.rs)
**Topics:**
- Structs for ML models
- Enums for architectures
- Option<T> (no null!)
- Result<T, E> (explicit errors)

**Key Takeaway:** Type-safe, composable ML pipelines

**Time:** 20 minutes
**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐☆☆☆

---

### Module 4: Performance (performance.rs)
**Topics:**
- Stack vs heap
- Zero-cost abstractions
- SIMD vectorization
- Memory layout for cache efficiency

**Key Takeaway:** High-level code → low-level performance

**Time:** 25 minutes
**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐⭐☆☆

---

### Module 5: Concurrency (concurrency.rs)
**Topics:**
- Threading (fearless concurrency!)
- Shared state (Arc + Mutex)
- Message passing (channels)
- Data parallelism

**Key Takeaway:** Safe parallel ML without data races

**Time:** 25 minutes
**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆

---

### Module 6: ML Examples (ml_examples/)
**Linear Regression:**
- Gradient descent from scratch
- Forward/backward pass
- Loss computation
- **Lines:** ~100

**Matrix Operations:**

- Activation functions
- **Lines:** ~140

**Neural Network:**

# Start here - run everything!
cargo run --release

# Quick 5-minute intro
cargo run --release --example quick_start

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Always Use --release for ML
```bash
# ❌ DON'T: cargo run
#    → 10-100x SLOWER (debug mode)

# ✅ DO: cargo run --release  
#    → Full optimization
```

### Tip 2: Read Compiler Errors Carefully
Rust's error messages are among the best in any language!

```rust
error[E0382]: borrow of moved value: `v`
  --> src/main.rs:4:20
   |
2  |     let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
   |         - move occurs because `v` has type `Vec<i32>`
3  |     let v2 = v;
   |              - value moved here
4  |     println!("{:?}", v);
   |                      ^ value borrowed here after move
```

The error tells you:
- What went wrong (borrow of moved value)
- Where it happened (line 4)
- Why (value moved on line 3)
- How to fix it (use a reference or clone)

### Tip 3: Use VS Code with rust-analyzer
Get real-time type hints, errors, and suggestions!

```bash
# Install rust-analyzer extension in VS Code
code --install-extension rust-lang.rust-analyzer
```

## 📞 Getting Help

### In Order of Preference:

1. **Read the error message** 
   → Rust errors are incredibly helpful!

2. **Check WALKTHROUGH.md**
   → 600+ lines of explanations

3. **Read code comments**
   → Every file is heavily documented

4. **Rust documentation**
   → https://doc.rust-lang.org/

5. **Ask on forums**
   → https://users.rust-lang.org/

6. **Discord/Reddit**
   → Active Rust community

## 🎉 Success Criteria

You'll know you're making progress when:

✅ Compiler errors make sense (not scary!)
✅ You think about ownership naturally
✅ You write `&` and `&mut` instinctively  
✅ Performance optimizations come naturally
✅ You catch bugs at compile time (not runtime!)
✅ You parallelize without fear
✅ Your ML code is both fast AND safe

## 🏆 Final Challenge

Once comfortable, try building:

**A Real-Time Image Classifier**
- Load a pre-trained model
- Process images with ndarray
- Serve predictions via HTTP
- Deploy with <10ms latency

This uses everything you've learned:
- Ownership (efficient memory management)
- Performance (optimization techniques)
- Concurrency (parallel batch processing)
- ML (model inference)

You've got all the tools you need!
